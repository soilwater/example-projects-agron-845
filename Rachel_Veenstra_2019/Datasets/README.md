# Datasets Folder

In this folder, find datasheets for running with the RAU_Calc code. Sheets must be in this format with the same four columns - Type, Sample_Wt(g), Sample_ID, and Absorbance. This system is important to follow and is being implemented in our lab to accomodate other data screening and analysis codes.


To analyze additional files, save them in this folder before running the code.
