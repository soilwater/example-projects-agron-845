# Final Results

In this folder, find final datasheets produced by the RAU_Calc code. These .csv files will contain four columns - Sample ID, nitrate concentration (micromoles/gram), ureide concentration (micromoles/gram), and final RAU calculations (%). It doesn't matter how many different samples are passed through the code, because data is sorted and matched based on the Sample_ID information.
