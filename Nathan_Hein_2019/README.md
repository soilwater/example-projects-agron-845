Title: Organizing and Displaying Calculated Results from a HOBO Sensor

Objective:
Organize temperature and relative humidity data and calculate hourly temperature average, difference, and use relative humidity to calculate hourly average and vapor pressure deficit.

Rationale:
During our heat stress experiments we use HOBO loggers to log the temperature and relative humidity on 5 or 15 minute intervals.  Since we leave these HOBOs in the field for the duration of the stress period (a month or more), when we extract the data we end up with a CSV file that has upwards of ten thousand entries that end up having to be manually manipulated to allow for basic excel analysis. By creating a program to automatically filter and organize the CSV files we can save many hours of work and output consititent, reproducible results. 

Outcomes:
I want the program to output an organized CSV file that includes clearly labeled time, temperature, and relative humidity values along with simple calculations for analysis to include daily average and hourly average of temperature, relative humidity, and VPD. After completing the necessary calculation for average temperature and temperature difference between sensors, the program will compile the results into a line graph showing the average temperature throughout the night and also output a comparison heat map showing the temperature differential between the ambient conditions and the stress conditions.
