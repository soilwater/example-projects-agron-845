# Dryland yields of corn and sorghum as a response to precipitation in NW and SW Kansas
To study the yield response of sorghum and corn to precipitation and drought in the NW and SW Kansas crop districts.  <br/>

**Project area**: Analysis of yield response to precipitation in Kansas landscapes

## Objective
Precipitation on the Great Southern Plains is highly variable from year to year. The management of available precipitation by farmers underpins the prosperity of the region. This effort evaluates the potential for yield efficiency of corn and sorghum in years of deficit moisture in the summer growing season.

## Outcome
The efficiency curves for dryland yields of corn and sorghum illustrate the regional discrepancies in efficiency of water productivity, particularly in years of deficit water supply. The curves equally convey a need for management schemes that align opportunities for yield responsiveness given the spectrum of potential availabilities of water supply.

## Method ##
A Frontier Efficiency analysis with the Douglas-Cobb function is used to assess the efficiency of yield productivity given a quantity of precipitation. This analysis is done for both dryland corn and sorghum in the Northwest and Southwest crop reporting districts for years of deficit water supply during the summer season. A quantile approach is undertook by dividing the variants of precipitation into six quantile groups.
