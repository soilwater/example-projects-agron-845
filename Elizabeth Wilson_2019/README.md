# Comparing composition similarity between microbial communities
**Script description:** This script (named 'Wilson_final_project.ipynb') includes a comparison in composition between two microbial communities by calculating a Jaccard index. Then, it displays the overlap in community composition using a proportional Venn diagram. For further site comparisons, 3-way proportional Venn diagrams are included as well. Finally, abundance data from six different sites are used to generate a dissimilarity/distance matrix that is then converted into a heat map. The script provides ways of visualizing similarity between microbial communities, but it can also be applied to other ecological communities, differentially expressed genes, etc.
